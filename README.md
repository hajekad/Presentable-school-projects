# Presentable projects

This repository contains several coding projects that I've written since September 2021.
Those named "hw" are written in C and are assignments for my first semester.
Similarly, those named "hwpp" are written in C++ and are the most recent projects.
"Linked lists" are my practice programs for the final exam of 2021.
Each coding project has its own branch.
Some of these programs can use addtional testing bash scripts that are stored in the master branch of this repository.
